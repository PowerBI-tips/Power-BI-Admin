    "# Activity Log - Export\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author**: Melissa Coates  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Last updated and tested**: September 29, 2022 \n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This notebook exports data from the [Power BI activity log](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/admin/service-admin-auditing).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type of authentication**: You can log in with either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A domain user account (requires Power BI administrator permissions), or\n",
    "- A service principal (with permission to run admin APIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How data is being accessed:** The notebook uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Power BI Management Module for authentication: Connect-PowerBIServiceAccount\n",
    "- Power BI Management Module for extracting the activity log data: Get-PowerBIActivityEvent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type of script**: Interactive, ad hoc (non-scheduled). This notebook is a guided learning experience to get familiar with how to query the activity log. It's not a production-ready script. This script accompanies the Auditing & Monitoring content found in the [Power BI Deployment and Governance](https://www.coatesds.com/power-bi-deployment-and-governance) course. \n",
    "\n",
    "More information, including prerequisites, is included at the bottom of this notebook."

    "- **Cmdlet used:** This script uses the PowerShell cmdlet: [<u>Get-PowerBIActivityEvent</u>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoftpowerbimgmt.admin/get-powerbiactivityevent). \n",
    "- **One file per day:** It exports one JSON file per day (based on UTC time). Saving files, partitioned by day, is very useful when you want to store raw data over time. \n",
    "- **File name:** The format of the file name is: PBIActivityEvents-\\<DateOfEvents\\>-\\<DateTimeDataWasExtracted\\>.json - the suffix includes a datetime of when the extract was run is included so that if there are multiple executions of the same day, you know which one is newer (occasionally there are late-arriving events but that's not typically a big issue).\n",
    "- **File location**: For simplicity in this demo/training script, a local file path is used. When using this \"for real\" you want to retain the raw data permanently in a location that's secure and backed up. If you need to rely on the log files for formal security audits, store the files in an immutable location (so the files can't be altered or deleted),.\n",
    "- **Loop through range of time:** The range of time is specified with the first variable. It counts backwards from yesterday to determine how many days it should loop through. A maximum of one day is allowed to be extracted at once from the cmdlet (and its underlying API). That's why the loop runs once per day. \n",
    "- **Range of days:** The range will conclude with yesterday (UTC time). Today is intentionally ignored -- goal is to avoid having a partial day's worth of data in a file. (You might pull today's records in an ad hoc script, but not when exporting the data.)\n",
    "- **JSON file format:** The JSON format is used because, over time, new data elements will be introduced by Power BI. A flexible schema is necessary to accomodate that so that you don't miss when new types of data get added (i.e., you want to parse the JSON and retrieve what you're interested in \\*after\\* the raw data has been extracted, not during the data extraction). It is a best practice to store the raw data as-is, in an immutable location, so the data is reliable for auditing.\n",
