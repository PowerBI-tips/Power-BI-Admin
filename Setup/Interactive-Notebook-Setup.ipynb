    "## **Overview of .NET Interactive Notebooks**\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Jupyter (ipynb) notebook. It combines two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text cells in Markdown:** Azure Data Studio has adopted GTM - the  [Github Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). It extends the standard markdown standard.\n",
    "- **Code cells that represent executable scripts:** Each code cell has its own language, so it's possible to use different languages in a single notebook (like SQL, Python, or Spark if you like to write Scala or R).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was created in Azure Data Studio using the .NET interactive extension. You can view it in Azure Data Studio, Visual Studio Code, or your preferred tool that supports rendering of Jupyter notebooks. There are also free viewers available online. A notebook is just text under the covers, so you can even use a text editor in a pinch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The .NET Interactive Notebooks extension is the key to making this work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extension:** The [<u>.NET Interactive Notebooks</u>](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) extension needs to be installed and enabled in VS Code and Azure Data Studio. (It'll also install the Jupyter extension on its own.) Notice in the Getting Started area of the extension documentation that it has a prerequsite of .NET 6 SDK. The setup steps are summarized below in this notebook.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Data results:** Notebooks do retain state. That is, your data is saved with the notebook. You can clear results from the entire notebook so that your next save doesn't include the saved data:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Be careful about where you save your notebook if you save it with results in it.\n",
    "    - You can clear cells one by one.\n",
    "    - You can clear the entire notebook (using the eraser at the top right). \n",
    "    - WATCH OUT that you don't click the delete button when you intend to only clear data results.\n",
    "- **Text cells:** Written in markdown. Azure Data Studio provides a nice interface. In ADS you can use the rich text view if you like to use the formatting toolbar. There's also a split view, or the markdown view, if you prefer to write the markdown yourself.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Code cells:** For the Power BI auditing scripts, the code cells will use **PowerShell (.NET Interactive)** as the language type. This means the .NET PowerShell kernel is used instead of regular PowerShell kernel in order to use PowerShell Core (PowerShell 7+) in the notebook cells. Think of it as a hosted version of the PowerShell process. That hosted version determines which PowerShell version is used for execution of the code cells.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **File extensions:** With the .NET interactive extension, you can create notebooks with either a **DIB** file extension or a **IPYNB** (Jupyter) extension. The Jupyter notebooks with the IPYNB extension have nicer preview capabilities (ex: in GitHub). All of the files in the set of Power BI auditing scripts are Jupyter notebooks."
