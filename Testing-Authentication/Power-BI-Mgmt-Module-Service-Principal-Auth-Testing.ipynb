    "# Power BI Management Module Authentication - Service Principal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author**: Melissa Coates  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Last updated and tested**: August 22, 2022 \n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This notebook is a guided learning experience to get familiar with how to authenticate to the Power BI Management Module using a service principal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use a service principal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- When executing scheduled, unattended, operations.\n",
    "- When you have been granted authority to to run Power BI admin APIs, but you personally aren't a Power BI administrator.\n",
    "- When there's a technical blocker to using your user account to run Power BI admin APIs (ex: MFA is enabled, password hash isn't synchronized).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The [<u>service principal</u>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/read-only-apis-service-principal-authentication) requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An Azure AD app to be registered (and its associated service principal).\n",
    "2. A secret created for the app. (Tip: watch out for expiration dates - it defaults to 1 year.) \n",
    "3. Azure AD app membership in an Azure AD group. (Tip: suggested group name: Power BI Service Principals).\n",
    "4. Power BI tenant setting \"Allow service principals to use read-only Power BI admin APIs\" is enabled for your Azure AD group (from #3).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do NOT set up API permissions in Azure AD for your Azure AD app; in fact that causes an unauthorized error. Use of the Azure AD group & the tenant setting per (3) and (4) above are what controls tenant-wide read permissions for Power BI. Plus, workspace permissions where relevant. [<u>More info</u>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/read-only-apis-service-principal-authentication)."

    "**Update in the script before executing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Line 1: Azure AD app ID** (aka client ID)\n",
    "2. **Line 2: Azure AD tenant** ID (aka directory ID)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The script below will interactively prompt you for:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Azure AD app secret** (aka client secret / app password)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because this is for learning purposes, this script interactively prompts for the service principal secret to be passed into a credential object. \n",
    "- When you operationalize any of your scripts:\n",
    "    - The prompt for the app secret will need to be removed. If you're using a VM or similar, consider using the [Secret Management Module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement) published by Microsoft for managing the secret value securely in either a local vault or in Azure Key Vault. Do NOT store secrets, keys, or passwords directly in any of the scripts (or in a separate file if it's unencrypted or trivial to decrypt). Alternatively, you could use Azure Key Vault with services like Azure Functions, Azure Automation, or Azure Data Factory.\n",
    "    - You might also store the app ID and tenant ID securely as well, once you have a solution for handling the secret."
