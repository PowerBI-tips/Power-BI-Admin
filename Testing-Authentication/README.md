# Testing Authentication

This folder includes notebooks to help you test if authentication is working. This is useful to check before trying to run any of the other scripts.

There are two notebooks:
1. [User authentication](Power-BI-Mgmt-Module-User-Auth-Testing.ipynb)
2. [Service principal authentication](Power-BI-Mgmt-Module-Service-Principal-Auth-Testing.ipynb)

Both use the Power BI Management Module for authentication.
